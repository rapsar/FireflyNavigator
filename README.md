-Datasets\
first 3 columns are x,y,z positions (in meters); 4th column is time, expressed as frame number\
xyzt_wild.csv: dataset from recording in natural habitat (June 5th, 2019, 30fps)\
xyzt_tent.csv: dataset from recordings in the tent with 40 fireflies in it (June 2nd, 2019, 60fps)\

-Troubleshoot\
If nothing apears after loading the dataset, make sure you entered the path to the .csv file properly.\ 
The path must end by /xyzt_field.csv (for Mac) or \xyzt_field.csv (for Windows).\
If it still doesn't work:\
try a shorter path by moving .csv files to Desktop;\
try use keyboard "t" key to toggle between Timelapse and All-On.\ 
Timelapse is played at 60fps, so flashes are rare. Be patient!\
If the problem persists, please contact us.\
