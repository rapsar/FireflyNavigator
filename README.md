<br>Unzip the folder

-Controls
<br>use keyboard "t" key to toggle between Timelapse and All-On.

--touchpad + keyboard
	<br>up/down arrows to move forwards/backwards
	<br>command + touchpad to move up/down/left/right
	<br>control + touchpad to rotate view around current position
	<br>double click to focus on a specific flash

--mouse
	<br>scroll wheel to move forwards/backwards
	<br>right button to move up/down/left/right
	<br>wheel button (or middle button) to rotate view around current position
	<br>double left-click to focus on a specific flash
</pre>


-Datasets
<br>first 3 columns are x,y,z positions (in meters); 4th column is time, expressed as frame number
<br>xyzt_field.csv: dataset from recording in natural habitat (June 5th, 2019, 30fps)
<br>xyzt_tent.csv: dataset from recordings in the tent with 40 fireflies in it (June 2nd, 2019, 60fps)

-Troubleshoot
<br>If nothing apears after loading the dataset, make sure you entered the path to the .csv file properly. 
<br>The path must end by /xyzt_field.csv (for Mac) or \xyzt_field.csv (for Windows).
<br>If it still doesn't work, try use keyboard "t" key to toggle between Timelapse and All-On. 
<br>Timelapse is played at 60fps, so flashes are rare. Be patient!
<br>If the problem persists, please contact us.
